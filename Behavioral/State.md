* Category: Behavioral
* Intent:  State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
 
The state pattern solves following state specific problems:

An object should change its behavior when its internal state changes.
State-specific behavior should be defined independently by adding new states and it should not affect the behavior of existing states.
